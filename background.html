                    Meetup is an app/website that allows users to join groups and meet with other people. These places to meet are accessible and allow users to meet quickly and often.<br>
                    Unfortunately these events are user dependent and if an area is not very active than users will not be able to meet with others.

                    Quarantinechat allows user to recieve calls from strangers and have social interactions. The app also recommends icebreakers to encourage conversation.<br>
                    These calls are often just short term and rarely lead to any kind of meaninfgul relationship and often make the user feel lonely afterwards.
